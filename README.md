# character-tools

Character tools is a web application created to make it easier for me to create and edit character cards.

- [x] Character Editor
  - [x] Import .json .png & .webp character card
  - [x] Export .png & .json character card
- [ ] Character library: Save characters in a "on browser" library that use indexedDb
- [ ] LoreBook support

  - [ ] Character book embedding
  - [ ] LoreBook library
- [ ] JailBreak support
